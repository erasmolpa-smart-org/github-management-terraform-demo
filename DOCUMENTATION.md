## Technical Document: Assumptions and Future Improvements

### Assumptions:
1. **Manual Repository Management**: The current infrastructure involves manually managing all code repositories within the GitHub organization. This manual approach has led to inconsistencies in configurations across repositories.

2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Adoption**: The decision to adopt an Infrastructure as Code approach aims to ensure consistency in repository configurations and streamline the management of users within the GitHub organization.

3. **Initial Implementation**: The initial implementation focuses on creating repositories, managing team memberships, and assigning permissions within the GitHub organization.

4. **GitHub Organization Membership**: The GitHub organization does not have a centralized identity service configured. As a result, users will be added directly to the GitHub organization.

5. **Team Structure**: Developers are divided into two teams: Frontend and Backend. Each team has specific access levels to repositories based on their role.

### Future Improvements:
1. **Centralized State Management**:
    - *Description*: Implementing a centralized backend for storing Terraform state files will enhance collaboration and ensure consistency in infrastructure deployments.
    - *Technical Approach*: Use remote state management with separate state files for each resource type (e.g., repositories, teams, members).

2. **Modular Terraform Configuration**:
    - *Description*: Breaking down the Terraform configuration into separate modules for each resource type (e.g., repositories, teams) will improve code organization and maintainability.
    - *Technical Approach*: Create individual Terraform modules for managing repositories, teams, and memberships with reusable configurations.

3. **Scalability and Governance**:
    - *Description*: Enhancing the solution to support scalability and governance requirements, such as implementing policies for repository naming conventions and defining code owners for repositories.
    - *Technical Approach*: Define naming conventions using Terraform variables and implement code owners configuration using GitHub's CODEOWNERS file.

4. **Self-Service Provisioning**:
    - *Description*: Implementing self-service capabilities for developers to request repository creation and manage access permissions through an automated process.
    - *Technical Approach*: Develop a custom web application or use GitHub Actions to automate repository creation and permission management based on user requests.

5. **Import Existing Resources**:
    - *Description*: Adding functionality to import existing repositories, teams, and user memberships from the GitHub organization before fully implementing Terraform. This will ensure a seamless transition and preserve existing configurations.
    - *Technical Approach*: Use Terraform's `import` feature to import existing resources into Terraform state files, allowing for further management using Terraform.

6. **Naming Convention Enforcement**:
    - *Description*: Enforcing naming conventions for repositories to maintain consistency and improve clarity across the organization's codebase.
    - *Technical Approach*: Define naming conventions in Terraform variables and use input validation to enforce these conventions during resource creation.

7. **Code Owners Configuration**:
    - *Description*: Implementing code owners configuration for repositories to designate individuals or teams responsible for code review and approvals.
    - *Technical Approach*: Utilize GitHub's CODEOWNERS file and Terraform's GitHub provider to programmatically configure code owners for repositories.

8. **Enhanced Collaboration**:
    - *Description*: Promoting a collaborative and service-oriented approach to infrastructure management, fostering cross-team collaboration and knowledge sharing.
    - *Technical Approach*: Implement features such as automated notifications, documentation generation, and centralized communication channels to facilitate collaboration among teams.

These assumptions and future improvements serve as a guideline for evolving the Terraform-based infrastructure management solution, addressing current needs while preparing for future enhancements and scalability.
