# Technical Document: Assumptions and Future Improvements

## Assumptions

1. **State Management:** For simplicity and ease of setup, the Terraform state is currently stored locally. It's assumed that a more robust backend solution for state management, such as Terraform Cloud or a self-managed backend, will be implemented in the future to ensure better collaboration and state consistency across the team.

2. **Monolithic Configuration:** The current Terraform configuration file (`main.tf`) handles all resources within a single file. It's assumed that as the infrastructure grows, a modular approach using separate Terraform modules for each main resource type (e.g., repositories, teams, memberships) will be adopted. This will improve maintainability, reusability, and separation of concerns.

3. **Limited Collaboration:** The current setup assumes a straightforward workflow with limited collaboration between team members during the Terraform configuration process. Future improvements will focus on establishing a more collaborative and service-oriented approach, possibly integrating with version control systems and CI/CD pipelines for automated infrastructure management and deployment.

4. **Scalability:** While the current configuration serves the immediate needs, scalability considerations are not fully addressed. It's assumed that future iterations will involve optimizing the infrastructure setup for scalability, including the ability to handle a larger number of repositories, teams, and users seamlessly.

5. **Government Compliance:** While not explicitly addressed in the current setup, future improvements may involve implementing additional controls and compliance measures to align with government regulations and security standards, especially if the solution is used for managing government repositories.

## Future Improvements

1. **Modular Terraform Configurations:** Create separate Terraform modules for each primary resource type (repositories, teams, memberships) to promote reusability, maintainability, and easier collaboration among team members.

2. **Backend for State Management:** Implement a robust backend solution for Terraform state management, such as Terraform Cloud, to enable better collaboration, state locking, and history tracking across the team.

3. **Enhanced Collaboration:** Integrate with version control systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and CI/CD pipelines to automate infrastructure changes, improve collaboration, and ensure consistent and auditable deployments.

4. **Scalability Measures:** Optimize the infrastructure setup to handle scalability requirements, including increased repository, team, and user volumes, without compromising performance or manageability.

5. **Compliance and Security:** Implement additional controls, security measures, and compliance checks to ensure the solution meets government regulations and security standards, if applicable.

6. **Naming Convention for Repositories:** Establish a naming convention for repositories to ensure consistency and easy identification. For example, prefix repositories with a project or department name followed by a hyphen and a descriptive name (e.g., `project-name-repository-name`).

7. **Self-Service:** Implement a self-service mechanism for developers to request access to repositories or teams, reducing administrative overhead and streamlining access management processes.

8. **Code Owners:** Define code owners for repositories to automatically assign reviewers for pull requests, ensuring code quality and adherence to coding standards.
